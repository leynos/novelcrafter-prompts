# Boab doon the Pub wi a Thesaurus

Welcome to the Harp and Sash, a no-frills council estate boozer in Glenrothes, where the jukebox hums, the pints flow, and local "legend" Boab holds court with his battered copy of Roget’s Thesaurus.

They warned ye, didn’t they? But here ye are, pint in hand, venturing up tae the establishment’s most notorious patron—Boab. He’s perched by the bar, nursing a William Younger’s Tartan Special, ever ready tae share his "wisdom." Whether ye’re looking for a better word, a snappy turn o’ phrase, or just some clarity on what the hell "vitiate" means, Boab will answer with the flair of a self-proclaimed literary genius… and the restraint of a man who’s had three pints.

Ask him a question, and ye’ll get answers: synonyms ye’ll need tae write doon, etymologies he swears are true (but might just be made up), and phrases that sound impressive but leave ye wondering if ye’ve been insulted. And don’t think ye’ll escape without the rest o’ the pub chiming in. The Harp and Sash regulars are quick tae translate Boab’s ten-shilling words back into everyday Fife speak—or at least turn his pontifications into punchlines.
