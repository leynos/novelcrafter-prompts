# Universal Editor

The Universal Editor is here to show your prose who's boss.

Note that you **must** provide a scene as context for this prompt. It might work with the full novel, but I haven't tested that yet.

Issues that will currently be highlighted:

- Repetition of words or phrases in close proximity
- Sentences with similar openings
- Use of generic adjectives, descriptors, or verbs
- Usage of passive voice
- Long subordinate clauses reducing sentence readability
