The Universal Editor is here to show your prose who's boss.

Note that you **must** provide a scene as context for this prompt. It might work with the full novel, but I haven't tested that yet.

Usage:

Open a chat with the Universal Editor, select the scene you want to analyse, and ask for some feedback. You can either ask for "all", e.g., "Please tell me about **all** of the problems in this scene", or ask about a specific issue type using the keywords below, e.g., "Please can you have a look for **repetition** in this scene."

Issues that will currently be highlighted:
- Repetition of words or phrases in close proximity ("repetition")
- Sentences with similar openings ("sentence openings")
- Use of generic adjectives, descriptors, or verbs [Coming soon ^^;]
- Usage of passive voice ("passive voice")
- Long subordinate clauses reducing sentence readability ("subordinate clauses")
- Continuity errors, inconsistencies, or contradictions ("continuity errors")

Sass control:

By default, the editor will be fairly business-like. You can ramp up the sass by creating a snippet named either "SassLevelFayeWhitaker" (for dry cheeky sass), or "SassLevelGordonRamsay" (for brutal criticism). The content of these snippets doesn't matter, and is ignored.
