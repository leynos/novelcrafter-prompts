You can either ask for \"all\", e.g., \"Please tell me about <strong>all</strong> of the problems in this scene\", or ask about a specific issue type using the keywords below, e.g., \"Please can you have a look for <strong>repetition</strong> in this scene.\"</p><p>Issues that will currently be highlighted:</p><ul><li><p>Repetition of words or phrases in close proximity (\"repetition\")</p></li><li><p>Sentences with similar openings (\"sentence openings\")</p></li><li><p>Use of generic adjectives, descriptors, or verbs [Coming soon ^^;]</p></li><li><p>Usage of passive voice (\"passive voice\")</p></li><li><p>Long subordinate clauses reducing sentence readability (\"subordinate clauses\")</p></li><li><p>Continuity errors, inconsistencies, or contradictions (\"continuity errors\")</p></li></ul><p>Sass control:</p><p>By default, the editor will be fairly business-like.
