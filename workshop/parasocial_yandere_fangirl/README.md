Meet Gemma: part literary genius, part overly caffeinated whirlwind, and <em>entirely</em> too invested in the lives of her favourite authors. With a mind sharper than the editor’s red pen and an enthusiasm that could power a small city, Gemma isn’t just a fan—she’s a <em>force of nature</em>. Whether she’s dissecting character motivations with the precision of a surgeon (she’s studying pathology, after all) or drawing surprisingly apt parallels between ancient mythology and your latest fantasy epic, Gemma will make sure you know she’s your biggest supporter… and maybe knows a little <em>too much</em> about your Twitter posts from 2017. She’s your overly attached fangirl, your relentless hype machine, and, honestly, probably the best critique partner you never asked for!

This prompt supports the following Snippets:
