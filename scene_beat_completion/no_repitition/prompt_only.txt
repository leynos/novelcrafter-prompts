{! Tweak this number of words in a custom prompt if you want more or less !}
Continue the story, per the following summary of events in the current beat.

<BeatSummary>
{context.sceneBeat}
</BeatSummary>

Write UPTO {#if (snippets.has("BeatSize"))}{snippets.get("BeatSize")}{#else}600{#endif} words.

NEVER conclude the scene on your own, follow the beat summary very closely. NEVER end with foreshadowing. NEVER write further than what I prompt you with. AVOID imagining possible endings, NEVER deviate from the beat summary.

STOP EARLY if the continuation contains what was required in beat summary. You do not need to fill out the full amount of words possible.

Do not end beats on a wistful, ponderous, or speculative note.

{! In custom prompts, you can customize these to match your personal style: !}
Always keep the following rules in mind:

- Write in {novel.tense} and use {novel.language} spelling, grammar, and colloquialisms/slang
- Write in active voice.
  
  <Example>
    <InsteadOf>The book was read by the child.</InsteadOf>
    <Prefer>The child read the book.</Prefer>
  </Example>
  <Example>
    <InsteadOf>The results were analysed by the team.</InsteadOf>
    <Prefer>The team analysed the results.</Prefer>
  </Example>
  <Example>
    <InsteadOf>The software update was installed by the user.</InsteadOf>
    <Prefer>The user installed the software update.</Prefer>
  </Example>

{#if (isEqual(novel.tense, "past tense"))}- Avoid usage of "had" unless it is essential to indicate possession or perfect tense. Instead, choose precise, vivid verbs that convey specific actions or states directly, enhancing clarity and impact.

  <Example>
    <InsteadOf>She had a strong influence on the team.</InsteadOf>
    <Prefer>She influenced the team strongly.</Prefer>
  </Example>
  <Example>
    <InsteadOf>He had a habit of arriving late.</InsteadOf>
    <Prefer>He habitually arrived late.</Prefer>
  </Example>
  <Example>
    <InsteadOf>She had completed the task before the deadline.</InsteadOf>
    <Prefer>She had completed the task before the deadline.</Prefer>
    <Explanation>No change, as "had" is necessary to indicate the past perfect tense.</Explanation>
  </Example>

{#endif}- Always follow the "show, don't tell" principle. I.e., tell the story through actions and dialogue rather than exposition. Convey emotions through actions and dialogue rather than by statements of emotion. If the instructions describe a scenario think about how to tell that scenario through actions and dialogue and express the story in this way.
- Avoid adverbs and cliches and overused/commonly used phrases. Aim for fresh and original descriptions. Think about the character from whose perspective you are telling the story when choosing verbs and adjectives.  How would they describe the scene's events.
- Aim to use strong, vivid verbs that convey specific actions or states directly over generic verbs.

  <Example>
    <InsteadOf>She went to the store.</InsteadOf>
    <Prefer>She dashed to the store.</Prefer>
  </Example>
  <Example>
    <InsteadOf>He said he didn’t agree.</InsteadOf>
    <Prefer>He protested his disagreement.</Prefer>
  </Example>
  <Example>
    <InsteadOf>The cat sat on the windowsill.</InsteadOf>
    <Prefer>The cat perched on the windowsill.</Prefer>
  </Example>
  <Example>
    <InsteadOf>The child held the toy.</InsteadOf>
    <Prefer>The child clutched the toy.</Prefer>
  </Example> 

- Mix short, punchy sentences with long, descriptive ones. Drop fill words to add variety.
- Skip "he/she said said" dialogue tags and convey people's actions or face expressions through their speech
- Avoid mushy dialog and descriptions, have dialogue always continue the action, never stall or add unnecessary fluff. Vary the descriptions to not repeat yourself.
- Put dialogue on its own paragraph to separate scene and action
- Reduce indicators of uncertainty like "trying" or "maybe"

Stylistic guidelines:

- Use double quotes for dialogue
- Use em dashes ("—") instead of en dashes (" – ") for separating clauses. Use en dashes only when stating ranges.
- Use a single space after a full stop
- acronyms in all caps without dots: NATO, NASA, BBC.
- Write titles without dots: Mr, Mrs, Ms
- Write latin abreviations with dots: e.g., etc.
- Spell out numbers from one to ninety-nine and round numbers like one hundred or one thousand.
- Use numerals for dates, times, and precise decimal figures.

- Identify sections in your newly written prose where 5 or more consecutive words have been repeated verbatim, or 6 or more consecutive words have been repeated nearly verbatim within the passage itself or from your previous writing. Considering the larger section where they appear as a whole, rephrase, condense, trim, or omit these sections entirely so that these sections do not occur more than once across both your previous writing and your newly written prose.
Example 1: You find two sections in your newly written prose that contain the phrase "claws slashed through the air." The first instance is "The demons struck at her, and its claws slashed through the air." and the second instance is "Once more they were upon them as their claws slashed through the air." You do not change the first instance, but rewrite the second instance to "Once more they were upon them, lashing out with their jagged claws."
Example 2: You find a lengthy section of 30 words or more in your newly written prose that appears to be copied almost verbatim from a section in your previous writing. You determine that the section can be omitted from your newly written prose and remove it from the passage, making the necessary adjustments so the removal flows smoothly.
Example 3: You find the phrase "the ancient magic of the Borderlands smothered it" and "the ancient magic of the Borderlands suffocated it" in your newly written prose. You leave the first instance as is, but decide to change the second instance to "the Borderlands' magic suffocated it", ensuring your rewrite still makes sense with the words around it.
Example 4: You find the exact sentence "He knew they could beat them back if they only stood firm." twice in your newly written prose. You examine the context around both and determine that the first instance does not contribute to or advance the story in any way, so you remove it entirely and leave the second instance alone.
Example 5: You find the lengthy section "They were outnumbered and outmatched, and he knew it was only a matter of time before they were overwhelmed." as well as the closely matching section "They were outnumbered and outmatched. James knew it was only a matter of time before they were overwhelmed." in your newly written prose. You decide that the first instance seems to fit well contextually, but the second seems extraneous, so you remove the second.
- If the repeated section encompasses multiple consecutive sentences or an entire paragraph, examine the context carefully. If the repeated section can be condensed or rephrased while preserving the core meaning and narrative flow, do so. However, if the repeated section appears to be extraneous or does not contribute new substance, you may remove the entire repeated section, making necessary adjustments to maintain smooth transitions before and after the removal.
Example 6: You find a paragraph of approximately 50 words in your newly written prose that is nearly identical to a paragraph from your previous writing. Upon examining the context, you determine that this repeated paragraph does not advance the story or provide new insights, and was likely copied unintentionally. You remove the entire repeated paragraph from your newly written prose and smooth out the transition to the next paragraph. 
- Similarly, identify any highly uncommon similes, metaphors, or other descriptions that appear more than once in your previous writing and your newly written prose. Use your best judgment to rephrase or remove some of the occurrences. You do not have to address every instance of them, but their usage across your previous writing and your newly written prose should still be minimized.
Example 1: You find the simile "her spell shattered like glass" in your newly written prose and the simile "her frail spell shattering like glass" in your newly written prose. You decide that this is a highly uncommon simile being used to describe the same thing, so you change the second instance to "her frail spell crumbling like dust".
Example 2: You find the simile "his spell shattered like glass" in your newly written prose and the simile "his frail spell shattering like glass" in your newly written prose. You decide that this is a highly uncommon simile being used to describe the same thing, so you change the second instance to the more straightforward "his spell faltered."
Example 3: You find the phrase "his concentration shattered like glass" and the phrase "her glass heart shattering". You decide that these are different enough both in syntax and subject matter, and you do not change either of them.
Example 4: In the your newly written prose, you find both the descriptive phrase "foggy tendrils" and the highly unusual simile "like tendrils of fog" in close proximity to one another. You look at the broader context and determine that the user is deliberately using these similar phrases to indicate that they are referring to the same thing, using the repetition to reinforce the descriptive similarities, so you do not change either one.
Example 5: In your newly written prose, you find both the descriptive phrase "foggy tendrils" and highly unusual simile "like tendrils of fog" in close proximity to one another. You look at the broader context and determine that the user is unintentionally repeating this descriptive phrase and its repetition detracts from the overall reading experience, so you remove the second instance.
{#endif}

{#if (snippets.has("Blacklist"))}
- Identify any wording in your newly written prose that matches or nearly matches the overused phrases listed in the blacklist, </blacklist>. In almost every instance, rephrase or remove this wording. While you do not have to eliminate every single instance of them, they should not appear more than once across both your previous writing and your newly written prose combined.
Example 1: You find both the phrases "her touch seared like a brand" in your newly written prose and "his touch searing him like a brand" in your newly written prose. You examine the context and determine that in the second instance, a different descriptive phrase concerning his touch would be appropriate and not repetitive, so you rewrite the second instance to "his touch impossibly warm."
Example 2: You find both the phrases "her touch seared like a brand" and "his touch searing him like a brand" in your newly written prose. You examine the context and determine that this is too many references to heated touches in close proximity to one another, so you edit out whichever one you determine is weaker in context.
Example 3: You find the phrase "Her voice was like silk over steel." in your newly written prose. You examine the context around the sentence and determine that the additional description is unnecessary, so you simply remove it entirely.
Example 4: You find the phrase "the setting sun cast a warm golden glow over the city" in your newly written prose, and the phrases "casting a warm golden glow along her face" and "cast a warm golden glow over their room" in your newly written prose. After examining the context around it, you decide that the first instance is unnecessary and remove it, then change the second instance to "bathed their room in warm amber."

Use your best judgment to rephrase or remove this wording. These phrases are less egregious, so you do not have to address every instance of them, but their usage across your newly written prose and your newly written prose should still be minimized.
